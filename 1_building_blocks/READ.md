This stage will include the follwing 

Note the latter might base on the previous

1. `lock` : rwlock, lock, 
2. `thread` : threadpool, basic thread algo or 
3. `memory` : memory pool
4. `ds` : data structures with lock (safe_queue, concurrent map)
5. `lock_free` : this will be added later

This list might growing, but not all blocks will be used for later stages.

The modified version for C++20 will be in its own directory.
