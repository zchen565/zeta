This stage will include the follwing 

Note the latter might base on the previous

- `lock` : rwlock, lock, 
- `thread` : threadpool, basic thread algo or 
- `memory` : memory pool
- `ds` : data structures with lock (safe_queue, concurrent map)
- `lock_free` : this will be added later
- `coroutine` : basic ones with coroutine (here we only we C++20)

This list might growing, but not all blocks will be used for later stages.

The modified version for C++20 will be in its own directory.
